<h2>Student Cliques</h2>
<b>Tutorial</b>
</table>
<p>
A fictional model of student clique formation on playgrounds. Students form a social network of varying
degrees of mutual friendship or dislike. Once let out of school, students try to move towards friends and
away from enemies. Additional forces tug on students to keep them near near the schoolhouse (the center
of the yard), and to add some randomness. Students change from red to blue as they become happier with
their situation.
