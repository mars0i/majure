AltStudents uses Student
StudentSimState uses AltStudents
Student contains step() which by definition is passed a SimState
and needs to read from StudentSimState
which contains the needed reference to AltState.
But what if I put a ref to AltState in each student?

student needs global state from altstate
simstate needs to call something that makes the students.


simstate doesn't need to know about students.
but it needs to know a way to get to students
since that's how each student gets info about the other students
unless each student knows how


note an alternative might be to not calculate positions and forces
object-orientedly in each student do it at the field level or something.
