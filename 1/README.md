MASON tutorial: Replacing Java with Clojure, v. 1
====

**See README.md in the root of this git repository for a general overview
of this project.**

----------

To compile, run the script compile.sh in 1/students.

----------

In this version, I replaced Student.java with Student.clj.
Not replacing the other files shows that, in this case, one can write
a drop-in replacement for the Java source file, using Clojure.  (See
the version in directory 2 for a case in which this is not quite
true.)
