## Clojure + MASON agent-based modeling library + Clojure: experiments 

These examples follow the tutorial in chapter 2 of the Mason manual v.
18.

### 1:

Replaces Student.java with Student.clj, i.e. reimplements the `Student`
class in Clojure.  The `Students` and `StudentsWithUI` classes are
still written in Java.

### 2:

Starting from *1*, replaces Students.java with Students.clj, i.e. both
`Student` and `Students` are written in Clojure.  `StudentsWithUI`
remains in java.
