## Clojure + MASON agent-based modeling library: experiments 

MASON can be found at
[http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason](http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason).

Clojure can be found at [http://clojure.org](http://clojure.org)

These examples follow the tutorial in chapter 2 of the Mason manual v.
18.

### 1:

Replaces Student.java with Student.clj, i.e. reimplements the `Student`
class in Clojure.  The `Students` and `StudentsWithUI` classes are
still written in Java.

### 2:

Starting from experiment **1**, replaces Students.java with
Students.clj, i.e. both `Student` and `Students` are written in Clojure.
`StudentsWithUI` remains in java.
