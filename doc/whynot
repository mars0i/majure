Why I can't do it using method X:


. According to the flowchart, you need gen-class to add methods beyond
what's in the interface, and I find that:

	.. Can't use reify to make students.Student because in addition to
	implementing Steppable's step method, I need to provide getAgitation.
	It's not in the Steppable interface, so it won't compile.

	.. Can't use defrecord for the same reason.

	.. Can't use deftype for the same reason.

	.. Can't use proxy to make students.Student because although it
	compiles getAgitation isn't found at runtime--because it's not
	in the Steppable interface, I guess.

. Question: What if I define a new interface? Can I "extend" an interface?
  Answer: Yes. gen-interface.  This works.

	.. However, this methods seems to make it impossible to specialize
	step on Students rather than SimState.  Is that correct?  This method
	is giving a speed of about 1/3 that of 3opt2 which uses gen-class
	but requires a little two-step for compiling.
