Why I can't do it using method X:


. According to the flowchart, you need gen-class to add methods beyond
what's in the interface, and I find that:

	.. Can't use reify to make students.Student because in addition to
	implementing Steppable's step method, I need to provide getAgitation.
	It's not in the Steppable interface, so it won't compile.

	.. Can't use defrecord for the same reason.

	.. Can't use deftype for the same reason.

	.. Can't use proxy to make students.Student because although it
	compiles getAgitation isn't found at runtime--because it's not
	in the Steppable interface, I guess.

	.. Question: What if I define a new interface? Can I "extend" an
	interface?
