Experiments using methods other than `gen-class` to define the
`Student` class, with `defprotocol` definterface` to define a new interface
that includes only `getAgitation`.  This interface is then used, along with Steppable,
by a `deftype Student`.  As in 3opt8, this is all done inside the Students namespace.
